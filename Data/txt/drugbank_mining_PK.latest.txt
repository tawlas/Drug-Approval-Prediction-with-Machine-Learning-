The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular reabsorption. 	Cisplatin decays monoexponentially with a half life of 20 to 30 minutes following administrations of 50 or 100 mg/m^2.  Cisplatin has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes. The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or more.	Cisplatin does not undergo instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma protein that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum itself is capable of binding to plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound.

Crizotinib	The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of crizotinib was lower at steady state (60 L/hr) after 250 mg twice daily than that after a single 250 mg oral dose (100 L/hr), which was likely due to autoinhibition of CYP3A by crizotinib after multiple dosing.

Triptorelin	In healthy male volunteers, total clearance of triptorelin was 211.9 mL/min.	The pharmacokinetics of triptorelin follows a 3 compartment model.  The half lives are estimated to be 6 minutes, 45 minutes, and 3 hours respectively.	Triptorelin does not bind to plasma proteins at clinically relevant concentrations.
Troxacitabine			
Ublituximab			
Urelumab			
Uridine triacetate		2 to 2.5 hours	
Vadimezan			
Valproic Acid	* 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2 [plasma clearance, total valproate]&#13;* 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m2 [plasma clearance, free valproate] &#13;* 4.8 ± 0.17 L/hr/1.73 m2 [males, unbound clearance]&#13;* 4.7 ± 0.07 L/hr/1.73 m2 [females, unbound clearance]	9-16 hours (following oral administration of 250 mg to 1000 mg) 	Concentration-dependent, from 90% at 40 µg/mL to 81.5% at 130 µg/mL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases. It may also affect the extent of protein binding of other drugs such as phenytoin or carbamazepine. 
Vandetanib		Median half life of 19 days.	Protein binding of about 90%.
Varlilumab			
Vatalanib		Approximately 6 hours.	
Veliparib			
Veltuzumab			
Vemurafenib	The total body clearance is 31 L/day.[A31274]	The elimination half-life of Vemurafenib is estimated to be 57 hours (range of 30-120 hours).[A31274]	Vemurafenib highly binds to plasma proteins where >99% of the administered dose will be found protein bound to serum albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.[A31274]
Venetoclax		26 hr	Venetoclax is highly bound to human plasma protein with unbound fraction in plasma <0.01 across a concentration range of 1-30 µM (0.87-26 µg/mL). The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.57.
Verubulin			
Vincristine		When intravenously injected into cancer patients, a triphasic serum decay patten was observed. The initial, middle, and terminal half-lives are 5 minutes, 2.3 hours, 85 hours respectively. The range of the terminal half-life is humans is 19 - 155 hours. 	~75%
Vinflunine			
Vinorelbine	The plasma clearance of vinorelbine is high, approaching the same as hepatic blood flow in humans, and its volume of distribution is large, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. In comparison to vinblastine or vincristine [A32354].	The terminal phase half-life averaged 27.7 to 43.6 hours; the mean plasma clearances ranged from 0.97 to 1.26 L/hr/kg [A32354]. 	80-90% [L2000]
Vintafolide			
Vismodegib		The half-life after a single dose is 12 days, and after continuous daily dosing is 4 days.	Vismodegib is highly protein bound with plasma protein binding at about 99%. Vismodegib binds to the plasma proteins, albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (saturable bnding).
Vitamin C		16 days (3.4 hours in people who have excess levels of vitamin C)	25%
